         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Salted butter, softened – I use salted butter, if using unsalted butter add an extra pinch or two of salt to the cookie dough.</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Brown sugar</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract – No, that isn’t a typo for the vanilla. These are a vanilla forward cookie and it makes them my FAVORITE ever.</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour – Just regular all-purpose flour works great</li>
            <li>Baking soda</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Favorite chocolate chips – Use whatever chocolate chips are your favorite or what you have on hand. You can even chop up a chocolate bar and use it in this recipe. I like ghirardelli chocolate chips for these!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to make the Best Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350° F.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or with an electric hand mixer, cream together the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar until light in color and fluffy in texture. This will take about 2 minutes. </li>
            <li>Scrape the sides of the bowl and add in the egg and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Add in the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix until a soft but not sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Fold in your favorite chocolate chips.
            </li>
            <li>Scoop the dough out into 1 1/2 tbsp portions (a #40 cookie scoop works great here) and arrange on your cookie sheet. Can use parchment paper, a silicone mat or an ungreased cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350° F for 8-10 minutes or until the cookies have spread and are just beginning to turn golden brown on the edges.</li>
            <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Recipe Websites</h3>
        <p>I found the <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/crunchy-pecan-cookies">epicurious</a> webstie very easy to navigate and straight to the point. When looking at recipes the pages are not overwhelemed with images or side stories on how a persons grandmother stumbled upon the perfect cookie recipe while following the yellow brick road. Its very condense and the ingredients/methods of preperation are very easy to find and understand. </p>

        <p><a href=https://pinchofyum.com/chicken-with-coconut-kale>Pinch of Yum</a> is a very easy website to naviagte when trying to find different dinner recipes to cook. It also allows for very interesting visuals that feel very girlish and welcoming. Additionally, the website allows you the option to skip ahead certain parts of the page, and for the most part, has all of their different sections organised and labeled. </p>

        <p><a href="https://pinchofyum.com/chicken-with-coconut-kale">Food. </a> is also another food website that is very easy to navigate, though its a little congested with information when opening to the main page. However, when looking at their recipes the pages are more condensed and straight to the point. Though its organized in an interesting way having the ingredients and the preperation steps next to eachother (seems a little confusing).</p>

        <h3>Non-Recipe Websites</h3>
        <p>I feel like <a href="https://www.newyorker.com">The New Yorker</a> is one of those websites that is very visual interesting to look at, and they create hierchy through their methods of organization is very interesting. I especially enjoy how interactive their website is. </p>

        <p>I also enjoy the way <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a> sets up their website in the way that a physical newspaper would be set up. Since a newspaper is already a set visual language most people are familiar with, it makes it easier to navigate the website when following those visual cues.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com">Vanity Fair</a> is like the NYT in how it utlizes the standard layout of a magazine to influence how visual heirarchy is translated to web form. I also particularly like how interactive it is when it comes to changing the size of the window, transforming to your visual needs.</p>
