        <h1> Introductory Questions!</h1>
        <h3>by Julianys Echevarria</h3>
        <p.First> <strong>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc). </strong></p.First>
            <p>My name is Julianys Echevarria. I am a Communication Design Major in my Junior year.</p>
        <p.First><strong>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong> </p.First> 
            <p>I was born in Puerto Rico but moved to the United States when I was younger. My family and I currently reside in Rochester, NY.</p>
        <p.First><strong>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong></p.First>
            <p>I am not super experience with HTML, but in my typography class last semester we were required to 
                create an html file for an article we had found online. The goal of the project was to play around 
                with creating an interactive reading experience, but we didn't do much of a deep dive on the inner
                workings of HTML's. (We were also given a pre-made html file to edit from so we didn't really make it from 
                scratch).
            </p>
        <p.First><strong>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class. </Strong></p.First>
            <p>I hope to become more knowledgeble on coding as a language. Whilst I'm not interested in being a web developer, having this kind of knowledge seems useful.</p>
        <p.First><strong>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</Strong></p.First>
            <p>I feel like designing for screens will be more restrictive and more tedious.</p>
        <p.First><strong>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</Strong></p.First>
            <p><a href="url">https://eyeondesign.aiga.org</a> This is a link to a website that holds articles on typography. I feel like the design is simple but effective in providing you with what you need as a visitor. I also think its fun how eyes appear on the screen when you idle in one place for too long.</p>
        <p.First><strong>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong></p.First>
            <p><a href="url">https://www.netflix.com</a> I'd say Netflix is one of those websites that is easy to navigate because of how simply it provides its information. When you are clicking through the different tabs you are given little options to click through with understandable headers that easily communicate where you'll be transfered to if you click on it. </p>
        <p.First><strong>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong></p.First>
            <p><a href="url">https://open.spotify.com</a> I think Spotify's website works well. Not only is it visually interesting and organized, its also fun to navigate as a veteran spotify user. However, I think newcomers would have a harder time using it.</p>
