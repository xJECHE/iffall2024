    <h3>LA LA LAND</h3>

    <h1>RECEPTION</h1>

    <section>
    <h3>BOX OFFICE</h3>
    <p><em>La La Land</em> was a major box office success, grossing $151.1 million in the U.S. and Canada and $320.9 million internationally, for a total of $472 million worldwide. With a production budget of just $30 million, the film earned a net profit of $68.25 million, making it one of the top 20 most profitable films of 2016. It was Ryan Gosling's highest-grossing film until <em>Barbie* surpassed it in 2023.</em></p>

    <p>The film's release strategy was a gradual build. It debuted with a limited release in five theaters in Los Angeles and New York City on December 9, 2016, earning $881,107 in its opening weekend—an impressive per-theater average of $176,221. The film expanded to 200 theaters in its second week, grossing $4.1 million and finishing seventh at the box office. By the time it expanded to 734 theaters, it had grossed $5.8 million over the weekend.</p>
        
    <p>After receiving 14 Academy Award nominations, the film's release expanded further. On January 6, 2017, the weekend of the Golden Globe Awards, it played in 1,515 theaters, earning $10 million. It continued to do strong business, grossing $14.5 million during Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. By the end of January, following its Oscar nominations, the film expanded to over 3,100 theaters and grossed $12.1 million.</p>
        
    <p>Despite its success, *La La Land* saw a slight drop-off following the Academy Awards ceremony. It grossed $4.6 million during the weekend of the Oscars (February 24–26) and $3 million the following week, after winning six Oscars, including Best Director for Damien Chazelle.</p>

    <h3>RESPONSE</h3>
    <p><em>La La Land</em> received widespread critical acclaim, with particular praise for Damien Chazelle's direction, the film’s cinematography, music, and the performances of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, especially their chemistry. The film holds a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The site's consensus describes it as a "thrillingly assured" film that "breathes new life into a bygone genre" with its heart and performances. On Metacritic, it scored 94 out of 100, reflecting "universal acclaim." Audiences also responded positively, giving it an "A−" grade on CinemaScore and an 81% positive rating on PostTrak.</p>

    <p>Critics were particularly enthusiastic about the opening musical sequence. Peter Travers of <em>Rolling Stone</em> gave it four stars, calling it a "hot miracle" and his favorite film of the year. Michael Phillips of the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> praised Stone's performance, calling her "reason enough to see La La Land," while A.O. Scott of <em>The New York Times</em> noted the film's ability to balance both fantasy and authenticity. Peter Bradshaw of <em>The Guardian</em> called it a "sun-drenched musical masterpiece," and Ty Burr of <em>The Boston Globe</em> highlighted its nostalgic qualities, especially in its treatment of jazz and Hollywood musicals.</p>
        
    <p>However, the film's critical success was not without controversy. The competition for awards with <em>Moonlight</em>, especially after the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, led to discussions about race and white privilege in the film. Some critics took issue with the portrayal of Gosling's character, a "white savior" figure, as he attempts to "save" jazz, a genre deeply rooted in African American culture. Critics like Kelly Lawler of <em>USA Today</em> and Ruby Lott-Lavigna of <em>Wired</em> pointed out the problematic portrayal of Gosling’s character in this context.</p>
        
    <p>The film was also lampooned by <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, which mocked the enthusiastic critical reception with a sketch about a man who found it "decent but also boring." Some critics, such as Rex Reed of the <em>New York Observer</em>, dismissed the film as old-fashioned and lacking energy, while others, like the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, critiqued its lack of nuance in character development and the leads' singing and dancing performances. Despite these criticisms, <em>La La Land</em> continued to be celebrated for its artistic achievements and its nostalgic revival of the musical genre.</p>
